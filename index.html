          <h3>Photographing Nature is Soul Soothing</h3>
          <p>
            Nature photography is a genre of photography that unlocks the beauty
            of natural elements in their natural habitat within a frame. It is
            an umbrella term that covers landscape photography, wildlife
            photography, and garden photography. The aspects of nature include a
            variety of subjects ranging from plants, animals, lush greenery in a
            personal backyard, to a hidden natural wonder that laughs with
            colors
          </p>
          <p>
            Nature photographers can showcase the intricacies and diversity of
            nature, from majestic landscapes to tiny insects, and help people
            see the world in a new light. Numerous studies say that nature can
            help ease anxiety and those who spend time in nature are happier.

          <p>
            Hi! My name is Amaka, I live in London, United Kingdom. I am a
            SheCodes student, and an aspiring nature photographer. I love
            photography because it helps me see the world in a different lens.
            It allows me to express my creativity, capture memories and connect
            with nature.
